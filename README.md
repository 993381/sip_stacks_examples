# SIP stacks using

Personal research and learning project.
Playing with four OpenSource SIP libraries:

  * [PJSIP](http://www.pjsip.org/)
  * [Sofia-SIP](http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/)
  * [libeXosip2](http://www.antisip.com/doc/exosip2/)
  * [libre](http://creytiv.com/re.html)

Simple UA for each library just to register to proxy.

Also provides examples of OPTIONS packet send for sofia-sip, pjsip and libre.
